Open and dock this window somewhere handy by following these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose menu: \nTools | Fungus | Flowchart Window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag-and-drop the Flowchart window to the location you wish to dock it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Flowchart window is now docked and part of your Unity window layout:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding the example folders and scene files\n\n\nTwo folders are created when you install Fungus, the Fungus features themslves (in folder 'Fungus') and a set of examples (in folder 'FungusExamples').\n\n\nExamples include Drag and Drop, Sherlock and Fungus Town:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the left-hand side of the Unity Project window to explore each example folder:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can 'filter' the Project view to show all scenes (and no other files) by clicking the scene filter icon to the right of the search bar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can cancel the filter by clicking the 'x' in the search bar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading and playing the example scenes\n\n\nTo \nload\n an example scene, double click the desired example's scene object in the Project window, and the scene should load. For example, this screenshot shows the scene and Flowchart windows when the DragAndDrop example scene has been loaded:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \nrun\n the currently loaded scene (i.e. to enter \nPlay-mode\n), click the Unity 'play' triangle button at the center top of the Unity application window, and then do whatever makes sense in that scene (e..g click/type text/drag-and-drop objects etc.!):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: you click the 'play' button a second time to end \nPlay-mode\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges made during playmode don't persist\n\n\nAs with all Unity projects, you can \nchange\n the properties of gameObjects while a scene is running, but these changes are 'ephemeral' - they only last while the scene is running. As soon as you end play mode the properties of all objects in the Hierarchy will revert to those saved in the Scene file.\n\n\nThis makes it easy to 'tweak' values of objects in \nPlay-mode\n, and then when the desired behaviour is achieved, those values can be set for the saved scene properties.\n\n\nValues set when Unity is in \nEdit-mode\n will be saved when you saved your scene (\nCTRL-S\n / \nCommand-S\n, or menu: \nFile | Save Scene\n).\n\n\n\n\n\nChange your preferences to highlight Play-mode\n\n\nSometimes we can forget we are in Unity \nPlay-mode\n, and then make changes to Hierarchy gameObject values that are then 'fogotton' when we do stop playing the scene. A good way to avoid this problem is to to set a 'tint' to the Unity editor to make it visually very clear to us when we are in \nPlay-mode\n. To add a tint to \nPlay-mode\n do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Unity preferences dialog by choosing menu: \nFile | Preferences ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \nColors\n preferences, and choose a light colored tint (we chose a light green in this case):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose the dialog (changes are saved automatically).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you next enter \nPlay-mode\n you'll see most of the Unity Editor windows turn green (apart from the Game and Flowchart windows):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating, naming and saving a new scene from scratch\n\n\nTo create a new scene in Unity do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose menu: \nFile | New Scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: if you have any unsaved changes for the current scene you need to either save or abandon them before a new scene can be created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have a shiny new scene, with a Hierarchy containing just one gameObject, a Main Camera. The new scene will have been give the default name \"Untitled\", which you can see in the title of the Application window:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood practice is to save your scene (in the right place, with the right name), before creating your work in the scene. Let's save this scene in the root of our project \"Assets\" folder, naming it \"demo1\". First choose menu: \nFile | Save Scene As...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the location and name (we'll choose folders \"Assets\" and scene name \"demo1\"):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have successfully saved the scene you should now see the new scene file \"demo1\" in your Assets folder in the Project window, and you should also see in the Application window title that you are currently editing the scene named \"demo1\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu: Tools | Fungus\n\n\nThe core Fungus operations are available from the Unity \nTools\n menu.\n\n\nChoose menu: \nTools | Fungus\n to see the options available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, there are 2 submenus, \nCreate\n and \nUtilities\n, plus the \nFlowchart Window\n action (which reveals the window if already open, or opens a new window if the Flowchart window was not previously opened).\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu: Tools | Fungus | Create\n\n\nThe Fungus Tools \nCreate\n submenu offers the following actions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu: Tools |  Fungus | Utilities\n\n\nThe Fungus Tools \nUtilties\n submenu offers the following actions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Flowchart\n\n\nTo create a Fungus Flowchart do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose menu: \nTools | Fungus | Create Flowchart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new \nFlowchart\n gameObject should appear in the Hierarchy window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \nFlowchart\n gameObject in the Hierarchy window, and you'll see the \nFlowchart's\n properties in the Inspector Window:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not already displayed the Flowchart Window, you can do so by clicking the Flowchart Window button in the Inspector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, when a new Flowchat is created a single command Block named \"New Block\" is automatically created, with the Event handler \"Game Started\" (so it will start executing Fungus commands as soon as the scene goes into \nPlay Mode\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowchart Block property viewing and editing\n\n\nLet's change the name of the default command Block of a new Flowchart in the Flowchart window to \"hello\". Do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new Fungus Flowchart (if you haven't already done so).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to select the Block in the Flowchart window (when multiple blocks are present, the selected one gets a green highlight border).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Inspector change the text for the Block Name property to \"hello\". You should see the Block name change in the Flowchart window:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Say command\n\n\nTo add a \"Say\" command to a Block do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the Block is selected, and you can see its properties in the Inspector, and ensure the name of the Block is \"hello\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the Plus button in the bottom half of the Inspector window, to add a new Command to the Block's properties:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose menu: \nNarrative | Say\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this Block only has one Command, that command is automatically selected (shown with a green highlight).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \"Story Text\" textbox in the bottom half of the Inspector window type in \"hello Fugus world\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the scene, and see Fungus create a dialog window, and output the text contents of your Say command:",

If a Block has any of the possible Execute On Events chosen (such as Game Started, Message Received, Sprite Drag Completed, Key Pressed etc.) then this Block will be displayed as a \nblue rounded rectangle\n:\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the default Block created with every new Flowchart automatically defines the Game Started Execute On Event, so this default Block always is displayed as an Event Block.\n\n\nNOTE: A Block with an Execute On Event will always appear as an Event Block in the Flowchart, regardless of whether its Commands contain menus or calls to 2 or more Blocks). In other words, in terms of Flowchart appearance, display of an Event Block overrides display of a Branching Block.\n\n\n2: Branching Block - orange polygon\n\n\nIf a Block is \nnot\n an Event Block, and its Commands include Calls and/or Menu commands to execute Commands in 2 or more other Blocks, then in the Flowchart window this Block will be displayed as a Branching Block, visually appearing as an \norange polygon\n.\n\n\n\n\n3: Standard Block - yellow rectangle\n\n\nIf a Block is \nneither\n an Event Block \nnor\n a Command Block, then it is a Standard Block, and will be displayed as an \nyellow rectangle\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnections between Blocks: Flow of Execution\n\n\nA whole scene's logic can rarely fit all into a single Block, therefore we need ways for one Block to pass execution control to other Blocks. There are several ways to do this, the most common being:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Call Command\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Menu Command\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecuting Commands in another Block with the Call Command\n\n\nThe Call Command tells Fungus to go and start executing the Commands in named Block. There are several ways to do this, we can tell Fungus to Stop execution completely in the current Block, and just pass control to named Block. We can also tell Fungus to go and completed all Commands in the named Block, and when they are finished, to then continue executing any remaining commands in the current Block. Finally, and perhaps the most complicated/sophisticated technique, we can tell Fungus to both started executing Commands in a named Block WHILE simultaneously continuing to execute remaining Commands in the current Block.\n\n\nTo pass control to another Block, and stop executing Commands in the current Block, do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) If you have not already done so: Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene, and select the Block in the Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename this Block \"Start\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd to Block \"Start\" a Say Command with the Story Text \"I am in Start\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new Block to your Flowchart named \"Block2\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd to Block \"Block2\" a Say Command with the Story Text \"I am in Block2\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd to Block \"Block2\" a Call Command, by choosing menu: \nFlow | Call\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this Call Command Selected, in the Inspector choose Block2 from the list of Blocks for property \nTarget Block\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: We will keep the default of \nTarget Flowchart\n (None), which means the current Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: We will keep the default of \nCall Mode\n Stop, which means that execution in the current Block (Start) will stop once execution of the called Block has begun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now see an arrow in the Flowchart window, connecting Block \"Start\" with Block \"Block2\". This visually tells us (the game developer) that a Call or Menu Command is present inside Block \"Start\" that tells Fungus to execute commands in Block \"Block2\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecuting Commands in another Block with Menu Commands\n\n\nLet's use a Say command above to ask a tricky mathematical question, and demonstrate the Menu command by offering the user a choice been \"correct' and \"incorrect\" answers.  Menu commands transfer control to another block - so we'll need to add 2 new blocks to correspond to the 2 answers.\nDo the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene, and select the Block in the Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the Block in the Flowchart to \"Question\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Say command, with \nStory Text\n to ask the question: \"Is 2 + 2?\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncheck the \"Wait For Click\" checkbox (this is so we see the menu options immediately after the Say command has displayed the question):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new Block, named \"Correct\" which contains a \nSay\n command with the text \"Well done, you are very mathematical!\". Click the plus-sign button in the Flowchart window to add a new Block to the Flowchart, rename it \"Correct\" and then add that Say command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \"Question\" block, and add a Menu command by clicking the plus-sign add Command button in the Inspector and then choosing menu: \nNarrative | Menu\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this new Menu command selected (green) in the top half of the Inspector window, set the \nText\n to \"Yes\" and the \nTarget Block\n to your new \"Correct\" block:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now see how the 'flow' of commands can change from Block \"hello\" to Block \"Correct\" in the Flowchart window:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a second new Block named \"Wrong\", containing a Say command with text \"Bad luck, perhaps consider a non-mathematical career path...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to add another Menu command to our \"hello\" block, offering the user the \"No\" answer to our maths question, and passing control to Block \"Wrong\" if they disagree that 2 + 2 = 4. Select the \"hello\" block, and add a Menu command. With this new Menu command selected (green) in the top half of the Inspector window, set the \nText\n to \"No\" and the \nTarget Block\n to your new \"Wrong\" block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now see in the Flowchart window how block \"hello\" can pass control to either block \"Correct\" or Block \"Wrong\" - depending on which menu answer the user selects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the scene, and you should see the Say question appear at the bottom of the screen, and also the two Menu buttons \"Yes\" and \"No\" in the middle of the screen. Clicking \"Yes\" then runs the \"Correct\" Block's commands, and clicking \"No\" runs the \"Wrong\" block's commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlighting connection between blocks by selecting command\n\n\nIn the Inspector window, if you select a Call or Menu Command (executing Commands in another Block in \nthe same Flowchart\n), then you'll see the arrow between the 2 Blocks highlighted in GREEN:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting a Block event handler\n\n\nEvents are one way to declare when you want execution of the Commands in a Block to begin. Typical events include:\n\n\n\n\nGame Started\n\n\nFlowchart enabled\n\n\nMessage Received\n\n\nKey Pressed (Up / Down / Repeat)\n\n\nSprite clicking / drag-dropping interactions\n\n\n\n\nThe most common Event used to define when a Block should start execution is, of course, the \nGame Started\n event. Each new Flowchart automatically starts with a single empty Block that is defined to begin execution when the game starts:\n\n\n\n\nTo change the Event defined for a Block, or to assign an event for a Block that had None, do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Block in the Flowchart window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Inspector window, for property \nExecute On Event\n choose from the popup menu the desired Event:",

Consider the following Tom and Jerry scene:\n\n\n[Tom] Where is that mouse?\n[Jerry] Where is that cat?\n[Tom] Aha...\n[Jerry] Arrrrggggggg!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nTo implement the above in Fungus we need to create and name two Characters. Do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene, and select the Block in the Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the Flowchart Block \"cat and mouse\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose menu:\n\nTools | Fungus | Create | Character\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now see a new gameObject \"Character\" in the Hierarchy window, named Character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure gameObject \"Character\" is selected, and edit its properties in the Inspector.

Also set the direction that the image is facing (left / front / right):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a second character (e.g. John, using Name Color blue, and portrait image 'annoyed').\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow select your Block in the Fungus Flowchart, so you can add some Commands to be executed...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Say command, for your Sherlock Character, saying \"Watson, have you seen my violin?\" and choosing portrait 'confident' (since this is the only we added to the Character):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a second Say command, this time for Character John, saying \"No, why don't you find it yourself using your amazing powers of deduction...\" and choosing the 'annoyed' portrait for John.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run the scene you should see a sequence of statements, clearly showing who is saying both with (colored) name text AND also the portrait image you selected for each Say command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in some of the Fungus Example projects, many games will have a wide range of different portrait images for each character, to allow a full range of visual expression of emotion to support the text of Say commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Stage\n\n\nPortrait images can be used in two ways in Fungus.\n\n\n\n\nThey can be shown as part of the \nSay\n commands in the Say Dialog.\n\n\nAlternatively Portraits can be displayed and moved around the screen inside Fungus \nStages\n, using the Portrait Command.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a simple stage that covers the whole game Window as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene, and select the Block in the Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the Flowchart Block \"stage demo\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Fungus Stage gameObject in the scene by choosing menu:\n\nTools | Fungus | Create | Stage\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now see a new gameObject \"Stage\" added to the scene Hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you select it you will see its properties in the Inspector. We can leave the default settings, since these are for the stage to cover the whole Game window. There are some child gameObjects inside the Stage, but you don't need to worry about these unless you are doing some advanced customisation of stages for a particular game effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have added a Fungus Stage to your scene, you will be able to make large Portrait images appear / move in-out of the screen using the \nPortrait\n Command in Fungus Flowchart Blocks...\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying Portrait images on stages with the Portrait command\n\n\nOnce you have a Fungus Stage, and a character then you can instruct Fungus to display / move onscreen the Character Portrait images. To make character images appear as part of a scene do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene, and select the Block in the Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the Flowchart Block \"sherlock enters dramatically\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Fungus Stage gameObject in the scene by choosing menu:\n\nTools | Fungus | Create | Stage\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new character, name the gameObject \"Character1 - Sherlock\", set the Name Text to \"sherlock\" and the Name Color to green. Add to this character a portrait (we used the sherlock-confident image from the Fungus Example project \"Sherlock\"). And set the image facing to the appropriate side (in our case: left):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Portrait Command by clicking the Add Command button (the plus-sign \"+\"), then choosing menu:\n\n\n\nNarrative | Portrait\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will now see your new Portrait command in the top half of the Inspector, and its Command properties in the bottom half of the Inspector. Note the red exclamation mark at the right of the highlighted (green) Command row - this indicated when a command has one or more required properties that have not been set. We see the error message \n\"No character selected\"\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the portrait's character to \"Character1 - sherlock\", and set the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nPortrait: confident\n\n\nFacing: \n-- (left)\n\n\nMove: Yes (check the checkbox)\n\n\nFrom Position: Offscreen Right\n\n\nTo Position: Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run the scene, the Sherlock portrait image should move into view having started from Offscreen - Right. The image stops when it gets to about a third the way onto the screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, a common Command flow sequence is:\n\n\n\n\nto have a character enter on screen (Portrait command),\n\n\nthen have that character say something (Say command),\n\n\nthen have another character enter the screen (Portrait command),\n\n\nand then that second character says something (Say command).\n\n\n\n\nHere is just such a sequence for the \"Case of the missing violin\" two-sentence scenario explored in the recipe to learning how to create Fungus Characters (recipe: Listing portrait image(s) for use by Characters):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see the Play Mode user experience of the output of running such a workflow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also see that the character that is Say'ing something, has a WHITE-outline around its Stage portrait, to visually reinforce to the user which character is speaking at any point in time...\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay some music\n\n\nMusic sound clips loop, so they are restarted once they have finished playing. Often the first Command in a Block is a \nPlay Music\n Command. Add music to a Block as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene, and select the Block in the Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Play Music Command to the current Block by clicking the Add Command (plus-sign \"+\" button) in the Inspector, and then choosing menu: \nAudio | Play Music\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the Play Music command is selected (green highlight) in the top of the Inspector, and then drag the desired music clip file into the \"Music Clip\" property in the bottom half of the Inspector:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the volume as desired\n\n(the default is 1, values are between 0.0 and 1.0, representing percentages of volume from 0% - 100%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay your scene - the music clip should play, and keep looping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: If you wish to start playing the music clip from a known time-point (rather than from the beginning), then enter the desired time-point in the Inspector property \"At Time\" for your Play Music command.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd menu commands to branch to other blocks\n\n\nLet's use a Say command above to ask a tricky mathematical question, and demonstrate the Menu command by offering the user a choice been \"correct' and \"incorrect\" answers.  Menu commands transfer control to another block - so we'll need to add 2 new blocks to correspond to the 2 answers.\nDo the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene, and select the Block in the Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the Block in the Flowchart to \"Question\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Say command, with \nStory Text\n to ask the question: \"Is 2 + 2?\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncheck the \"Wait For Click\" checkbox (this is so we see the menu options immediately after the Say command has displayed the question):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new Block, named \"Correct\" which contains a \nSay\n command with the text \"Well done, you are very mathematical!\".

You can change this as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) Create a new 2D scene, unless you already have a scene with which to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Main Camera in the Hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Inspector for the Camera component, click and choose a different value for the Background property - often black works well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow when any part of the camera rectangle (frustrum) shows no gameOjects then your custom Background colour will be what the user sees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a background sprite\n\n\nTo add any sprite image file from your Unity Project folder into the current scene, simply drag a reference to the sprite image file from the Project window onto the Scene window, and rotate / resize desired. The sprite will appear as a new gameObject (with same name as Sprite Project image file) in the Hierarchy window:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: You may not be able to see the sprite, because what we see depends on the current settings for the camera. What the camera shows, how it moves etc. can be controlled by Fungus Views and Commmands relating to Views.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding and customising a view\n\n\nWhat the main camera of a scene displays to the user, and how it moves etc. can be controlled by Fungus Views and Fungus Commmands relating to Views. A Fungus View is a special gameObject in the Hierarchy, it appears as a green outlined inner rectangle, with two filled green rectangles on the left and the right. The ratio of the outlined inner rectangle is 4:3. The ratio of the outer rectangle (which includes the two filled green left and right rectangles) is 16:9. These two ratios cover almost every common phone, tablet and computer screen width-to-height ratio. So arranging the view so that a background Sprite image looks good for both inner- and outer- rectangles of a view, pretty much ensures your game will look good on any device. Setting the background color of the camera to something like black also means on the rare device that has an odd ratio showing content outside of the view outer rectangle, the game should still look perfectly acceptable.\n\n\nTo add a view to the current scene do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) Create / Edit a scene that has a Sprite background image gameObject\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose menu: \nTools | Fungus | Create | View\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename this View as \"View1\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the two white squares to resize the view (it maintains its proportions). Use the center square outline, or vertical and horizontal arrows to move the View around the Scene window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the View is selected in the Hierarchy, then position the view so that it is approximately centered on your background sprite image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResize (and if necessary reposition) the View to be as big as possible, but ensuring that its outer rectangle stays within the bounds of the background sprite. (Note we've tinted the Sprite red so the green View rectangles can be more easily seen in this screenshot):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You can also rotate the view with the Unity Rotate tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Utnil you add a \"Fade To View\" Fungus command, you still may not see the Sprite in the Game window when the scene plays, since the Main Camera has not been oriented to resize and align with the view.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Fade To View command\n\n\nOnce you have a Scene that contains some background Sprites and Fungus Views, you are ready to use the Fungus camera related Commands to control what the user sees. The simplest camera control is to make the Game window fade from a solid colour to the Main Camera being sized, positioned (and if necessary rotated) to show a specified Fungus View. Do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) Create / being editing a Scene containing a background Sprite image, and a Fungus View that has been positioned to show all / some of the Sprite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Fungus Flowchart rename the Block \"Camera Control\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new \"Fade to View\" Command to the Block. First click the Plus button in the bottom half of the Inspector window, to add a new Command, then choose menu: \nCamera | Fade To View\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Drag \"View1\" from the Hierarchy window into the \"Target View\" property of the Fade to View Command  in the Inspector:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(We'll keep the defaults of 1 second and fade From Color of black).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run the Scene the Game window should start off solid black, and then slowly the background Sprite image within the View rectangle should fade into view.\n\n\n\n\nNow Drag \"View1\" from the Hierarchy window into the",

With your Flowchart Block selected, click the Add Command button in the Inspector and choose menu: \nAudio | Play Sound\n. Drag in a sound effect (we chose the BearRoad sound from the Hunter example):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay the scene, you should hear your sound effect play once.\n\n\nNote. The default Fungus setting is for the sound effect to start playing, and while it is playing the next Command in the Block will start executing.

However, we can change this easily with the Set Audio Volume command. Do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(if you have not already done so: Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene, and select the Block in the Flowchart).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename this Block \"Play Music\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Play Music Command to the current Block, then drag the desired music clip file into the \"Music Clip\" property in the bottom half of the Inspector:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you play the scene now, the music will play at full volume (1 = 100%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow create a second Block in the Flowchart window named \"quieter\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd to this new Block a Set Audio Volume Command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the properties of the Set Audio Volume Command set the volume to 0.25 (25%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \"Play Music\" block, and add a Menu command by clicking the plus-sign add Command button in the Inspector and then choosing menu: \nNarrative | Menu\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the Text Property to \"Make Quieter\" and the Target Block to Block \"Quieter\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Flowchart window you should now see a green arrow, showing that a Command in Block \"Play Music\" passes control to Block \"quieter\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run the scene, the music will start playing at full volume, then when y ou click the \"Make Quieter\" button, control will pass to the \"quieter\" block, and you'll hear the music become much quieter after the Set Audio Volume Command has been executed with a value of 25% (0.25):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 3 Unity audio concepts\n\n\nUnity has 3 different kinds of Audio 'object', that it is worth understanding when working with audio in Fungus (or any other) Unity project:\n\n\n\n\nAudio Clip\n\n\nAudio Listener\n\n\nAudio Source\n\n\n\n\nUnity Audio Clip\n\n\nUnity uses the term Audio \"Clip\" to refer to the physical sound files (.mp3, .wav, .ogg etc.) that are stored in your Project folder. It is these Audio Clip files that you drag and drop into the \"Music Clip\" and \"Sound Clip\" properties in the Inspector Window, when creating Play Music and Play Sound Commands in a Fungus Block.\n\n\nUnity Audio \"Listener\"\n\n\nBasically, if you want sound to be played there must be an Audio Listener component inside one of the gameObjects in your scene. The Main Camera of a scene has one by default, so in most cases you just leave this alone and can rest assured that you have an Audio Listener.\n\n\nIf a scene has no Audio Listener in any gameObject, then no audio will be heard by the user of the game, regardless of how many music and sound clips might be playing.\n\n\nSometimes you may add gameObjects to your scene that contain another Audio Listener component. In this case, Unity will present a warning message stating that more than 1 Audio Listener is present in the scene. If you see such a message, then its best to resolve this problem by disabling all but one Audio Listener...\n\n\nIf you are working with a 3D game, and/or you wish to present a sophisticated stereo sound experience for your user, then you may need to learn about 3D audio. In such games the 3D \"position\" of the gameObject containing the Audio Listener becomes important - but don't worry about this if you are just getting started with audio in Fungus. For 3D effects the Audio Listener is like an \"electronic ear\", so its location determines things like how loud a sound is played (distance from \"ear\") and left-right stereo balance (which \"side\" audio is to the \"ear\") etc.\n\n\nUnity Audio Source\n\n\nIn Unity the link between an Audio Clip (music/sound) file that we wish to be played, and the Audio Listener in the scene is a Unity Audio Source component of a gameObject. However, in most cases Fungus creates one of these if needed, so we don't need to worry about them!\n\n\nHowever, for sophisticated control of music and sound and speech in your game there is the facility to make Fungus have detailed control of Unity Audio Sources. It is an Audio Source component that controls how and when and which part of an audio clip is playing (and whether it should loop or not), and whether it is playing or paused, and when resuming should continue from where paused or restart. The volume of a playing clip can also be controlled by properties of an Audio Source.\n\n\nLearn more about audio in Unity at the \nUnity Manual Audio Page\n.\n\n\n\nControl Audio command\n\n\nThe Fungus Audio Commands cover all common music and sound effect actions, for specialist audio work you may need to access the raw (and complicated) power of Unity audio. The Fungus Command \"Control Audio\" lets Fungus Blocks communicate directly with Unity Audio Source components in any gameObject in the current scene, so your wizard audio team member can do what they need to do with the Unity toolkit, and you can still control playing / looping / volume etc. of the audio in those complex gameObjects.\n\n\nThe Control Audio Command offers five actions that can be communicated to Unity Audio Source components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll learn about this with a simple Unity gameObject that plays a bear sound two times, first at full volume and then reduces the volume before playing a second time, using three \"Control Audio\" Fungus Commands. Do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) If you have not already done so: Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene, and select the Block in the Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename this Block \"Control Audio\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Hierarchy Window create a new Empty gameObject, choose menu: \nCreate | Create Empty\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename this new empty gameObject \"GameObject - bear sound\" (or whatever sound name makes sense in your project).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate your desired audio clip file in the Project window, and (with \"GameObject - bear sound\" selected), drag a reference to the audio clip from the Project window into the Inspector:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Audio Source component should now be added in the Inspector to \"GameObject - bear sound\". Un-check the Play On Awake property in the Inspector (to stop this sound from playing as soon as the scene begins - \nwe\n want to be in control of this Audio Source object...):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith your Flowchart Block selected, click the Add Command button in the Inspector and choose menu: \nAudio | Control Audio\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag the  \"GameObject - bear sound\" gameObject from the Hierarchy into the Audio Source property in the Inspector, and select the Wait Until Finished checkbox (so Fungus will wait for the sound to finish playing before moving on):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the default Control action for a Control Audio Command is \"Play Once\" - we'll leave this property unchanged, since we want our bear sound inside our gameObject to be played once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you run the scene now, you'll hear the bear sound play once at full volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince all three of the Control Audio commands we need use a link to \"GameObject - bear sound\" the fastest workflow is to \nduplicate\n each Command, and just change the bits we need. So duplicate your Control Audio command by clicking the Duplicate Command button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the newly copied command, change the Command action to Change Volume, and choose a volume of 0.25 (25%):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, make a duplicate of the first Control Audio Command (that Plays the sound). Drag this new Command to be last in the sequence of commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow when you play the scene, first the bear sound linked to in the Audio Source component of gameObject \"GameObject - bear sound\"  should play at full volume, then (after having its volume reduced to 25%) it should play a second time at a much reduced volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Tags (in Say Commands)\n\n\nSince often dialog authors will know just what sound effects or music they wish to associate with their characters utterances, Fungus allows audio-related 'tags' to be embedded in the text of Say Commands. There are four audio related tags:\n\n\n{audio=AudioObjectName} Play Audio Once\n{audioloop=AudioObjectName} Play Audio Loop\n{audiopause=AudioObjectName} Pause Audio\n{audiostop=AudioObjectName} Stop Audio\n\n\n\nUsing tags like this make it important to carefully \nname\n the gameObjects in the Hierarchy window. To explore how to control sounds in gameObjects do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(setup) If you have not already done so: Create a new scene, add a Fungus Flowchart to the scene, and select the Block in the Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename this Block \"Say audio tags\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Hierarchy Window create a new Empty gameObject, choose menu: \nCreate | Create Empty\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename this new empty gameObject \"audioBearRoar\", or whatever sound name makes sense in your project, but avoid spaces in the name of this game object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate your desired audio clip file in the Project window, and (with \"audioBearRoar\" selected), drag a reference to the audio clip from the Project window into the Inspector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUn-check the Play On Awake property in the Inspector for the Audio Source component (to stop this sound from playing as soon as the scene begins - \nwe\n want to be in control of this Audio Source object...):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith your Flowchart Block selected, click the Add Command button in the Inspector and choose menu: \nNarrative | Say\n. Enter the following for the Story Text property of this Say Command \"... and then the bear roared loudly {audio=audioBearRoar}\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun your scene - the bear sound will play after the text has been displayed:",

You can omit dialogue text, but remember you still need to add the : character at the end of the line.\n\n\nString substitution\n\n\nYou can use the normal string subsitution syntax {$VarName} anywhere in the conversation text. For example if you have a string Flowchart variable called PlayerName you can embed this in a conversation like this:\n\n\njohn: Hi there {$PlayerName}.\n\n\n\n\nLocalization\n\n\nYou can use the string substitution feature above with a \nLua string table\n to localize the conversation for multiple languages.\n\n\nThe Conversation system does not work with the Localization component in Fungus because the syntax makes it difficult to localize that way. \n\n\nLua\n\n\nThe conversation() function in \nFungusLua\n starts a conversation in a Lua script. Lua's multiline string syntax [[ ]] is handy here. As the conversation() function takes a single string parameter you can also omit the usual function parenthesis.\n\n\nconversation [[\njohn: Hello!\n]]",

When one of the Commands is selected, that its properties are displayed in the bottom-half of the Inspector window.\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition\n:\nConditions are tests that are either \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\" at a particular point in time. Different Commands can be defined to be executed depending on the value of a condition test in a Fungus Block.\n\n\n\n\n\nCSV\n:\nComma Separated Variable - a computer file format where the values of rows and columns are recorded, in a form that can be loaded into a spreadsheet..\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom strings\n:\nAs well as the automatically generated rows for each Say, Menu, Command etc., you can also add your own rows to the localisation file using any string id you want. To use these custom strings, you use variable substitution.\n\n\nFor example, say you have a custom string called \"PlayerName\", you can put {$PlayerName} in any Say text to substitute the correct localised value from the localisation file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\nDraggable Sprite\n:\nA 2D image on screen that has been code to do something when clicked-and-dragged with the mouse or trackpad.\n\n\n\n\n\nDragTarget Sprite\n:\nA 2D image that has been defined to execute some action(s) if a Draggable Sprite is dragged and released over it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\n:\nAn application allowing the editing of game resources. The Unity Editor has multiple windows for viewing / editing properties of files, scene contents, UI dialogs, camera settings etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Handler\n:\nA Fungus Block or a Unity coded \"method\" that will be executed when a particular \"Event\" occurs.

Typical Flow commands include decision choices such as loops or IF-conditions etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowchart item id\n:\nThe unique number that is created for each Block of a Flowchart. This ID is used fpr serialisation (save and load) purposes, and not usually seen by the developer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowchart Localization id\n:\nA special, unique name, used for associating language localization data for each Fungus game project.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowchart Message\n:\nA Message is basically a piece of text, but one that plays the role of being able to act as a 'trigger event' to cause Blocks to start executing.\n\n\nMessages can be sent (via the \nFlow | Send Message\n Command), either to the current Flowchart, or to \nALL\n Flowcharts. One of the Events that can be defined to start the execution of a Block is if a particular Message has been received by the Flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowchart Window\n:\nA special window available in the Unity Editor for editing and working with Fungus Flowcharts and their Blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\nInteger variable\n:\nA variable that stores whole numbers, such as 100, 2, 0, -2 etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n\nLandscape orientation\n:\nAn orientation of an image or computer screen, where the width is greater than the height.\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Column\n:\nWhen you first export the localization .csv (Comma-Separated-Variable) file it has 3 columns (Key, Description, Standard).\nWhen you want to add a new language to the file you add a new column for that language. You can use whatever column name you like, though it's typical to use two letter language codes (FR, ES, DE, etc.).\n\n\nThe Set Language command is provided with the name of the column for the language you wish to use in Fungus.\n\n\n\n\n\nLibre Office\n:\nA free and Open Source alternative to Microsoft Office.\n\n\nLean more and download from: \nLibreOffice.org\n\n\n\n\n\nLocalization\n:\nLocalization and Internationalization refer to coding a game in such a way that it can be deployed in a manner supporting playing and interactions in multiple human languages.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogging\n:\nThe  \nScripting | Debug Log\n Command allows the writing ('logging') of messages to the Console window while a scene is running. Logs provide a record of what has happened when the game is running, useful for checking what happened was what was intended, or for debugging (hunting down where errors are located).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n\n\n\nMecanim Animation\n:\nA Unity file representing an animation clip or pose. Animators manage the changes or mixing between one Animation clip and another.\n\n\n\n\n\nMecanim Animator\n:\nA Unity state-chart controller, which manages animated gameObjects - deciding when and how quickly objects should 'blend' into a different state or animation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu Dialog\n:\nThe UI elements (background / lines / text) that define the visual style of how the Text of Menu Commands is presented to the user.\n\n\n\n\nFungus provides a default Menu Dialog, but custom variations can be defined, for different games / scenes / characters etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder in layer\n:\nIf multiple objects have been assigned to the same Unity Sorting Layer, then the numeric value of the Order in Layer property determines their visual sorting order (what appears in front of what).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\n\nParallax Sprite\n:\nThe use of 2D sprites, moving at different speeds, to give the impression of 3D movement (where sprites for objects meant to be further away from the user move more slowly than objects closer to the game object.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform build\n:\nRefers to the device and type of application that the Unity editor will create. Examples are stand alone applications for Windows, Mac OS, iOS phone, Android phone, X-BOX etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nPortrait\n:\nThe Fungus Portrait Command is used to make the game display one of the Character Portrait images on the Stage. A particular image can be selected, and it can be made to move on/off stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nPortrait orientation\n:\nAn orientation of an image or computer screen, where the height is greater than the width.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedural Sound\n:\nA method of creating sounds using computer algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate / Public variables\n:\nA Private variable as one that can only be accessed by Cmmands in Blocks in that Flowchart. A Public variable is one that can be accessed by Commands in Blocks in other Flowcharts as well as its own one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n\nSave profile\n:\nThe Save Profile is basically a string that gets prepended to the key used to save \n load variables in PlayerPrefs. This allows you to create  separate save profiles using different names. For example, player 1's save data might use the Save Profile 'Chris', while player 2's data would use the Save Profile 'Matt', and their data can be saved / loaded independently.\n\n\nThe typical workflow would be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a suitable value fo the Save Profile (e.g. \"player1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet Save Profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave Variable(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay Dialog\n:\nThe UI elements (background / lines / text) that define the visual style of how the Story Text of Say Commands is presented to the user.\n\n\n\n\nFungus provides a default Say Dialog, but custom variations can be defined, for different games / scenes / characters etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nScenes\n:\nUnity Scenes are like chapters in a book, or \"screens\" in a game, or \"levels\" in a game. They allow the logic of a computer game to be broken into components. The \"gameObjects\" in a scene determine what software components will be created when a Scene starts running (others may be created or deleted once the Scene has started).\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen aspect ratio\n:\nThe relationship of the width of an image or screen to its height. Typical rations include 4:3 ad 16:10.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen resolution\n:\nThe number of pixels wide and high a window or device supports.\n\n\n\n\n\nSorting layer\n:\nUnity 2D objects are assigned to a \"Sorting Layer\".

Sprite may be moved through Fungus Commands, or Unity code. Sprites can also be defined to be \"draggable\" by the users computer mouse pointer or mobile device touch gestures.\n\n\n\n\n\nStage\n:\nA Fungus gameObject in the scene, used to define the position and start-end movements of Character Portrait images controlled by Fungus Portrait Commands.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard block\n:\nA Fungus Block whose execution is \nnot\n triggered by an event (so it is not an Event Block), and which does \nnot\n cause the execution of 2 or more other Blocks (so is \nnot\n a Branching Block).\n\n\nNote: Standard Blocks are displayed as yellow rectangles in the Flowchart window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Text\n:\nWhen you export the localization file, there is a Standard Text field. This is populated with the text that has been entered into the Say, Menu, etc. text fields in the Unity editor. In normal usage, this field is in the localisation file for reference so localizers know what text needs to be translated. For example, if the project is drafted using English, then the text in Say, Menu Commands etc. would be in English, and in the exported localization file this text would appear in the Standard Text fields.\n\n\nNote, if you use the Set Language command with an empty language string then the values in the Standard Text field will be used when Fungus runs.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory Text Tags\n:\nSpecial instructions that can be embedded inside the Story Text of Say commands. Examples are tags that start/stop playing a sound, or send a message.\n\n\n\n\n\nString ID\n:\nThis is an automatically generated ID code, that is stored in the first column of the localisation file. These IDs are generated automatically when you export the strings using the Localization object.\n\n\nThe ID is needed since every localised text string needs a unique identifying name so that it can be mapped it back to the Say, Menu, etc. command that references it.\n\n\n\n\n\nString variable\n:\nA variable that stores text characters, such as the player's name, or colour of the potion they are carrying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\n\nTag\n:\nSpecial characters that can be inserted into Fungus Say Commands, to control other aspects of the scene, such as the playing of a sound, or the shaking of the camera, or the sending of a message to cause other Blocks to start executing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU\n\n\n\n\n\nUnity\n:\nA game engine and IDE (Interactive Development Environment) - with program code editor, and audio/graphics editing facilities. Able to build applications for deployment to Windows, Mac, Linus, iOS, Android, XBox etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnity UI\n:\nThe building of visual interfaces for computer programs deployed by Unity.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsfxr\n:\nA system for generating sound effects from mathematical parameters.\n\n\nBuilt into Fungus and based on the open source project at: \nUsfxr at GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n:\nA named memory location, from which values can be retrieved at a later date.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable default value\n:\nA \"default\" value refers to the value given to a variable automatically, if no particular value is specified. In the Variables section at the bottom of the Flowchart window, as well as defining the names and data types of variables, you can also set default values here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables Panel\n:\nThe very bottom section of the Flowchart window is where variables (such as score, playerName, carryingGreenKey etc.) can be defined for use in Fungus Commands.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable saving\n:\nThe saving of the value of a variable to the devices 'disk'. So when another Unity Scene is loaded, the saved value can be loaded from saved memory. The saved value can also be loaded the next time the game application is executed on a device.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable substitution\n:\n\n\nThis relates to the use of a tag in the Story Text of a Say Command, whereby the contents of a Variable will be inserted into that part of the text for the Say Command\n\n\n{$VarName} Substitute variable\n\n\n\n\n\nView, Move, Rotate, Scale \n Rectangle tools\n:\nThe core tools offered in the Unity editor for changing basic properties of 2D and 3D objects\n\n\n\n\n\nView\n:\nA Fungus gameObject that helps ensure good visual experience regardless of device aspect ration, and used for camera movements and control by Fungus Commands.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoice over\n:\nA sound clip file containing recorded audio that corresponds to text being displayed on screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\n\n\n\nWebplayer\n:\nA Build option in Unity that creates an application that can play inside web pages that have the Unity Web Player plug-in installed. The need fo the plug-in and web-player option are being replaced by the WebGL Unity build facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWebGL\n:\n\nWebGL\n is a technology available in modern browsers that allows for interactive, high quality computer graphics within web pages, without the need for any special plug-ins (such as Flash or the Unity Player). It promised to be the future for multimedia web page content and interaction.",

This allows you to create  separate save profiles using different names. For example, player 1's save data might use the Save Profile 'Chris', while player 2's data would use the Save Profile 'Matt', and their data can be saved / loaded independently.  The typical workflow would be:    Choose a suitable value fo the Save Profile (e.g. \"player1\")    Set Save Profile.    Save Variable(s).     Say Dialog :\nThe UI elements (background / lines / text) that define the visual style of how the Story Text of Say Commands is presented to the user.   Fungus provides a default Say Dialog, but custom variations can be defined, for different games / scenes / characters etc.   Scenes :\nUnity Scenes are like chapters in a book, or \"screens\" in a game, or \"levels\" in a game. They allow the logic of a computer game to be broken into components. The \"gameObjects\" in a scene determine what software components will be created when a Scene starts running (others may be created or deleted once the Scene has started).   Screen aspect ratio :\nThe relationship of the width of an image or screen to its height. Typical rations include 4:3 ad 16:10.   Screen resolution :\nThe number of pixels wide and high a window or device supports.   Sorting layer :\nUnity 2D objects are assigned to a \"Sorting Layer\". This allows images/text to be assigned to layers such as Background, Foreground, Middleground, UI (on top of everything) etc.   Spine :\nSpine is a third-party 2D animation system from  EsotericSoftware.com .   Spine Animation :\nAnimation clip based on the Spine 2D system, that can be controlled from Fungus Commands (once  the Unity Spine and Fungus Spine add-on packages have been installed).   Sprites :\n2D Images, that may be hidden / revealed. Sprite may be moved through Fungus Commands, or Unity code. Sprites can also be defined to be \"draggable\" by the users computer mouse pointer or mobile device touch gestures.   Stage :\nA Fungus gameObject in the scene, used to define the position and start-end movements of Character Portrait images controlled by Fungus Portrait Commands.   Standard block :\nA Fungus Block whose execution is  not  triggered by an event (so it is not an Event Block), and which does  not  cause the execution of 2 or more other Blocks (so is  not  a Branching Block).  Note: Standard Blocks are displayed as yellow rectangles in the Flowchart window.    Standard Text :\nWhen you export the localization file, there is a Standard Text field. This is populated with the text that has been entered into the Say, Menu, etc. text fields in the Unity editor. In normal usage, this field is in the localisation file for reference so localizers know what text needs to be translated. For example, if the project is drafted using English, then the text in Say, Menu Commands etc. would be in English, and in the exported localization file this text would appear in the Standard Text fields.  Note, if you use the Set Language command with an empty language string then the values in the Standard Text field will be used when Fungus runs.   Story Text Tags :\nSpecial instructions that can be embedded inside the Story Text of Say commands. Examples are tags that start/stop playing a sound, or send a message.   String ID :\nThis is an automatically generated ID code, that is stored in the first column of the localisation file. These IDs are generated automatically when you export the strings using the Localization object.  The ID is needed since every localised text string needs a unique identifying name so that it can be mapped it back to the Say, Menu, etc. command that references it.

You can create a LuaScript object via (Tools \n Fungus \n Create \n LuaScript).\n\n\n\n\nExecuteHandler component\n\n\nWhen you create a LuaScript object, you'll see that it contains a component called 'ExecuteHandler'. This component allows you to specify options for when the Lua script should execute. By default it executes the Lua script when the scene starts, but you can change this to execute after a delay, on every update, on trigger events, etc.\n\n\nIf you want to execute a LuaScript from a custom C# script, set On Event to 'Nothing' and instead call the LuaScript.OnExecute() method directly. You can also call the OnExecute() method from a UI event, e.g. a UI Button 'On Click' event.\n\n\nLua script and files\n\n\nYou can enter the Lua code you wish to execute directly into the 'Lua Script' text box. You can also put Lua code into a text file in your project and use the Lua File property to execute it. \n\n\nYou can also use both options at the same time. In this case, the Lua File contents are loaded first and the Lua Script text is appended to that. This is a handy feature for code reuse and configuration, e.g. create a Lua text file with Lua functions to control your game, and then call those functions from the Lua Script text box.\n\n\nLua modules and require()\n\n\nThe Lua module system allows you to create reusable packages of Lua code and include these in your Lua scripts. \nThis tutorial\n explains how to write Lua modules. Module files in FungusLua need to be put into a special folder structure so that the Lua require() function is able to locate them.\n\n\nTo use a Lua module:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Resources/Lua folder in your project. The capitalization here is important. The folder can be created inside an existing folder in your project.\n\n\nCreate a mymodule.txt file inside the Resources/Lua folder and add your Lua script to it. (Rename mymodule.txt to whatever you want).\n\n\nYou can now use the Lua require function to load the module for use in any Lua script, for example\n\n\n\n\nlocal mymodule = require(\nmymodule\n)\n\n-- Call a function in the module\nmymodule.myfunction()\n\n\n\n\nError messages\n\n\nWhen a script contains errors there are a few techniques you can use to track down the source. \n\n\nFungusLua compiles Lua code at scene startup so that it can be quickly executed when needed later on. This means you will usually see Lua syntax error messages in the console at startup (during compilation), and runtime errors when the script executes later on.\n\n\nAll Lua script errors generate an error message in the Unity log, displayed in red.\n\n\nFor example, if you try to run this invalid code in a LuaScript object:\n\n\nnot valid lua\n\n\n\n\nIt will generate an error message in the log like this\n\n\nLuaScript.LuaScript:(1,0-3): unexpected symbol near 'not'\n1: not valid lua\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first 'LuaScript.LuaScript' part gives you information about where the Lua script is running from.\n\n\nThe next part in brackets '(1,0-3)' tells you the line number and character range where the error is located.\n\n\nThe last part gives you a description of the type of error.\n\n\nThe next line on gives a listing of the Lua source code. Use the linenumber info above to locate the line causing the problem.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most common errors is attempting to access a variable that doesn't exist. In this example error message, we've tried to access the field 'name' on a variable v that hasn't been defined yet.\n\n\nLuaScript.LuaScript:(1,7-9): attempt to index a nil value\n1: print(v.name)\n\n\n\n\nTo resolve this type of error, carefully check that the variable you want to access has been defined, is spelled correctly and is what you think it is. You can use the print() and inspect() functions to display information about the object in the console. For instance, you may have added a binding to a gameobject, but forgot to select the correct component in the binding.\n\n\nFor runtime errors, a useful technique is to add print() calls in your code just before where the error occurs, and run it again. This way you can print out information to the console to help track down the cause of the error.\n\n\nMoonSharp includes a remote debugger tool which you can use to step through Lua code and inspect variables. See the \nLuaEnvironment documentation\n for more information.\n\n\nSetting the LuaEnvironment\n\n\nBy default the LuaScript component will use the first LuaEnvironment it finds in the scene to execute, or create one if none exists. If you want to use a specific LuaEnvironment, set it in the Lua Environment property. This is a good way to keep unrelated sets of Lua scripts sandboxed from each other.\n\n\nRunAsCoroutine option\n\n\nThis option will run the Lua script as a Lua coroutine which is useful for writing asynchronous code via the coroutine.yield() function in Lua. If you don't need to execute your Lua script asynchronously, deselecting this option will avoid the overhead of running as a coroutine. Recommended for advanced users only!",

This is the list of available functions for waiting and working with coroutines.  -- Waits for a number of seconds, then continue execution of Lua script\nwait(duration)\n\n-- Waits until the Lua function provided returns true, or the timeout expires.\n-- Returns true if the function succeeded, or false if the timeout expired\nwaitfor(fn, timeoutduration)\n\n-- Run a C# coroutine and continue execution of Lua script\nrun(co)\n\n-- Run a C# coroutine, wait until it completes, then continue execution of Lua script\nrunwait(co)",
